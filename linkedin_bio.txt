 I'm a software developer early in my career who's hungry for challenging work and high-impact roles. In the past I've built software at two startups, an enterprise software company, a research lab and several hackathons. I am a strong leader, with experience teaching dance, how to program programming, and as the president of my universities Cognitive Science Club. My unique perspective, coming from the humanities (philosophy) and the sciences (cognitive science), helps my decision making as I draw from a diverse set of experiences and corpora of study.



I am a software developer early in my career who's hungry for challenging work and high-impact roles. In the past, I've built software at two different startups, an enterprise software company, a research lab, and several hackathons. As president of my university's Cognitive Science club, I am a leader in my community. My interdisciplinary education combining the humanities and the sciences and my experience teaching both classical dance and computer programming has awarded me a truly diverse and unique set of experiences with which I can solve complex problems and form new and exciting ideas.
