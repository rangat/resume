I'm a software developer early in my career who's hungry for challenging work and high-impact roles. In the past I've built software at two startups, an enterprise software company, a research lab and several hackathons. I am a strong leader, with experience teaching dance, how to program programming, and as the president of my universities Cognitive Science Club. My unique perspective, coming from the humanities (philosophy) and the sciences (cognitive science), helps my decision making as I draw from a diverse set of experiences and corpora of study.
