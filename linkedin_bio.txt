I'm a software developer early in my career who's hungry for challenging work and high-impact roles. In the past I've built software at a couple startups, an enterprise software company, a couple research labs and a ton of hackathons. I am a strong leader, with experience teaching dance, programming, and as the president of my universities Cognitive Science Club. My unique perspective, coming from the humanities (philosophy) and the sciences (cognitive science), helps my decision making as I draw from a diverse set of experiences and corpora of study.
